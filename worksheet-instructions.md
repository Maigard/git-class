# Worksheet Instructions

You will need a computer to participate in the worksheet exercises.

You will be paired into a team of `2-3` people. Each member in your team will be assigned a letter `A`, `B`, or `C`.

Your entire team will work step by step to complete the worksheet.

At any given point in the exercise you will either be a `Driver` or an `Observer`.

`Driver`: Person preforming commands

`Observer`: Person observing commands

You are a driver when it is your turn to do something on your computer. You are an Observer when someone else in your team is the Driver. It is important that everyone in your team understands what the worksheet is having you accomplish.


## Tips

This is not a race - Each step is meant to be worked on by the entire team. We are all here to learn new skills, not complete the exercise as fast as possible.

Be patient with your team - If you know a concept that they do not then take some time to help them learn.

Ask for help -  we are more than happy to help!


## Differences from day 1

### `git init` vs `git clone`
On day one the first command we ran was `init`. This initializes, or creates, a repository which allows you to start tracking changes to files. On day two you will run the command `clone` followed by a URL to a GitHub repository. The `clone` command downloads a version of the repository that is located at the URL. The difference between these commands that `init` create a brand new repository and only has an effect on your computer. The command `clone` creates a version of someone else's repository on your computer.

You would want to use the `init` command if you are creating a brand new project or starting to use git with an old project.

You would want to use the `clone` command if you are wanting to work on a project with a friend or coworker.
