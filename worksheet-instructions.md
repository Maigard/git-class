# Worksheet Instructions

You will need a computer to participate in the worksheet exercises.

You will be paired into a team of `2-3` people. Each member in your team will be assigned a letter `A`, `B`, or `C`.

You and your team will follow the worksheets and work together to complete all of the steps.

At any given point in the exercise you will either be a `Driver` or an `Observer`.

`Driver`: Person preforming commands

`Observer`: Person observing commands

You are a driver when it is your turn to follow your worksheet. You are an Observer when someone else in your team is the Driver. It is important that you understand what the worksheet is trying to have you accomplish when you are driving as well as what your teammate(s) is/are trying to accomplish when you are observing.


# Example Process

1) Team member A forks the demo repository(https://github.com/harokevin/recipes)
2) Team member A gives team member B access to team member A's fork on GitHub
3) Team member A and B clone team member A's online fork onto their computers
- Check Point: Do all teammates have a version of the fork on their computers?
4) Team member A makes the first set of changes then opens a `Pull Request`
	- Create a `branch`
	- Make content changes
	- `add` changes, stage changes
	- `commit` changes, save changes
	- `push` changes to the remote/GitHub
	- Open a `Pull Request` on GitHub
5) Team member B reviews and accepts the `Pull Request`
6) Team member A merges the `Pull Request` into `master`
7) (Optional) Team members repeat steps 4-6 but B makes changes and merges and A accepts
- Check point: Has at least one `Pull Request` been merged?
8) etc.


## Tips

Be patient with your team. This is not a race. We are all in the same boat trying to learn new skills.

If you get stuck or something seems off ask one of the helpers.
