# Day 1 Homework

#### Install git on your computer - https://git-scm.com

To help you get more comfortable with the command line follow these steps:

 - Open your computerâ€™s terminal after installation.

 - Type the command `git -v` in your command line to make sure git is installed
   - You should see something like `git version 2.16.1`

 - Now that we know git is installed we can create our first empty repository
   - Type the command `mkdir test_repository` to make a folder
     - mkdir stands for Make Directory or make folder
 - Type the command `cd test_repository` to navigate to that folder
   - cd stands for Change Directory or change folder
 - Type the command `git init` in to create a new blank repository
   - init stands for INITialize repository or create repository
     - You should see something like this:
 - Initialize empty Git repository in my/file/directory/test_repository/.git/
   - The .git folder is what git creates and uses to track changes
